# Walmart-Sales-Analysis-and-Forecasting
This project aims to analyze Walmart's Sales data across its various Stores and Departments to identify key trends, seasonal patterns and forecast future weekly sales using traditional supervised machine learning model for time series forecasting

Datasets for this project can be found in Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting

**Key skills used:** 

- Time series analysis & forecasting
- Feature engineering & model optimization
- Python



**The problem:** Walmart needs to understand sales patterns across its locations and departments to plan inventory and promotions, especially during holidays and seasonal shifts.

**My insights:** 

- Store 20 consistently outperforms all others in sales; Store 33 underperforms.
- Department 90 is the highest revenue-generating department, while Department 43 is the weakest.
- Store Type A generates the most sales, while Type C lags behind.
- Clear seasonality observed: January has the lowest average sales, while November–December peak due to holidays.

**My recommendations:** 

- Allocate more inventory and marketing budget to top performing stores and departments.
- Reevaluate strategy for underperforming stores and departments.
- Tailor promotions and stock planning around seasonal peaks (especially Nov–Dec).
- Consider rebalancing store type footprint, favoring Type A layouts for future store openings.
- Use the tuned Random Forest model in production to forecast weekly sales and improve demand planning.
